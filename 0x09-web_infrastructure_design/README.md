<li>You must be able to explain system redundancy</li>
<li>Know all the mentioned acronyms: LAMP, SPOF, QPS</li>
</ul>

<h3>Copyright - Plagiarism</h3>

<ul>

<li>You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else’s work. </li>
<li>You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.</li>
<li>Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<h3>General</h3>

<ul>
<li>A <code>README.md</code> file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory</li>
<li>For each task, once you are done whiteboarding (on a whiteboard, piece of paper or software or your choice), take a picture/screenshot of your diagram</li>
<li>This project will be manually reviewed:</li>
<li>As each task is completed, the name of that task will turn green</li>
<li>Upload a screenshot, showing that you completed the required levels, to any image hosting service (I personally use <a href="/rltoken/m_O2HLsKrO1zg31LMcLOGQ" title="imgur" target="_blank">imgur</a> but feel free to use anything you want). </li>
<li>For the following tasks, insert the link from of your screenshot into the answer file </li>
<li>After pushing your answer file to GitHub, insert the GitHub file link into the URL box</li>
<li>You will also have to whiteboard each task in front of a mentor, staff or student - no computer or notes will be allowed during the whiteboarding session</li>
<li>Focus on what you are being asked: </li>
<li>Cover what the requirements mention, we will explore details in a later project</li>
<li>Keep in mind that you will have 30 minutes to perform the exercise, you will get points for what is asked in requirements</li>
<li>Similarly in a job interview, you should answer what the interviewer asked for, be careful about being too verbose - always ask the interviewer if going into details is necessary - speaking too much can play against you</li>
<li>In this project, again, avoid going in details if not asked</li>
</ul>
